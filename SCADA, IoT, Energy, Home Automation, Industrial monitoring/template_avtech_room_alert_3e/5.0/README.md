# RoomAlert 3E

## Overview

Zabbix template for the AVTECH Room Alert 3E environment monitor. This template can be used to monitor the temperature reading from the device's internal thermometer.


To use, create a new host with an SNMP Interface pointing at the IP address of the Room Alert 3E. This interface **must be set to SNMPv1** otherwise it will not be able to read the temperature.


Includes a 'high' alert trigger for temperatures in excess of 25°C and a 'critical' alert trigger for temperatures in excess of 30°C.
