        ## Description

        ## Overview
        
        All processes are described here:
        
        
        https://github.com/tudorticau/Synology-Backup-LLD-Monitor
        
        
        First step: setup syslogserver
        
        
        Second: configure zabbix to monitor using LLD
        
        
        All is tested and already implemented on production: over 40 NAS
        
        
        Template have 1 item and 1 trigger, but is LLD - this mean you don't have to take care how your admins will add and name the backup processes: all is done automatically
