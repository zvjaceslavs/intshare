    "link_desc": "<p>Hi, I was looking for a template to monitor HP Laserjet printers using SNMP. After some searching, none of them satisfied me. I created this one. It obtains several parameters and automatically ads them to the Inventory. Also gets several general parameters (startup time, ...) And what I was lloking for, it informs you of the installed cartridges and how much toner is left in each of them. As they are created in a discovery rule, it the template can be used directly with monochrome or color printers, without having to edit it. It also has several triggers that apply to the discovered toners.</p>\n<p>I have tested it with an HP Laserjet 500 Color and with an HP Laserjet 400. Both of them where using the generic PRINTER MIB.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps someone</p>",
