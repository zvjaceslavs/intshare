{"link_name": "zabbix-api-simple", "type": "API Library", "OS": "General", "vendor": "Others", "minZabbVer": "4.0.x", "link_desc": "<p dir=\"auto\" data-sourcepos=\"3:1-3:65\">This zabbix api implementation for Ruby strives for three things:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\" data-sourcepos=\"5:1-8:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"5:1-5:134\">To the greatest extent possible, be syntactically & structurally identical to the API as it is described in the Zabbix documentation</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"6:1-6:25\">Be API version agnostic</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"7:1-8:0\">Be internally simple, unobtrusive, and low-maintenance</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\" data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:547\">It accomplishes these goals primarily by deferring (via Faraday) to the Zabbix API itself for just about everything - it does not attempt to re-create or otherwise \"fancy-up\" the API. The reasoning behind this is that the zabbix api itself is complex enough, and the Zabbix project can alter the specifics of the api at any time. This library just provides Ruby semantics that closely follow the API specification. The advantage to you is that you do not need to wrap your head around two APIs (the Zabbix API proper, and the API library's API)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\" data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:547\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"auto\" data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:547\">Install with \"gem install zabbix-api-simple\"</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\" data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:547\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"auto\" data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:547\">Project: https://gitlab.com/svdasein/zabbix-api</p>", "features": "Zabbix Agent", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://gitlab.com/svdasein/zabbix-api", "price": 0, "link_hits": 508, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2021-04-21 07:36:38", "link_modified": "2021-09-12 21:52:28", "link_visited": 12, "publish_up": "2021-04-21 07:36:38", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "", "author": "", "user_id": 547, "link_id": 2416, "cat_id": "206,112", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
