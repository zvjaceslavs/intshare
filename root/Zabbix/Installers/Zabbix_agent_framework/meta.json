{"link_name": "Zabbix agent framework", "type": "Integration", "OS": "", "vendor": "Others", "minZabbVer": "2.2.x", "link_desc": "<h1>Zabbix (Agent) Framework</h1>\n<p>This tool is used to maintain external zabbix checks in <em>one place</em>. There are lot of places where it is possible to download many external checks. But there is problem with installation, update and centralised management. This tool should do all of this in easy steps. In future it can be <em>starting point</em> to install and configure zabbix agent on systems with one step. Primary goal is not to make all plugins available here but to be able to use any plugin and decentralized development. If you are maintainer of some external check, it is enough to create zaf file in your repo and use zaf installer everywhere.</p>\n<p>Next to this, this tool can even communicate with Zabbix API with <em>NO dependencies</em> to high level languages. Shell, sed and awk only.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-motivation\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/limosek/zaf/tree/1.3#motivation\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Did you install lot of zabbix agents and try to setup similar common user parameters? Do you want to setup them all? Do you want to change some zabbix agent options on lot of system? Do you want to write your own simple check or discovery rule for zabbix and it is nightmare to deploy same script on more zabbix agents? Are you tired searching some system specific agent check and setup them individualy? Do you want to auto simple backup all hosts in your zabbix to xml files? Or do you want to do some scripting on host depending on Zabbix server configuration? So zaf is here for you :)</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-features\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/limosek/zaf/tree/1.3#features\"></a>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimal dependencies. At this time, only sh, sed, awk and curl</li>\n<li>Minimal code (less than 50kb of code)</li>\n<li>Minimal runtime version to fit on different systems (openwrt, debian, ubuntu, ...)</li>\n<li>Modular. Zaf module can be maintained externaly from this framework</li>\n<li>Sharing code. Many zabbix external checks share common shell functions.</li>\n<li>Simplification of userparameter functions (does not have to be one-line long code)</li>\n<li>Zabbix discovery simplification. Creating zabbix item for discovery is not so easy in shell based system and result is not nice. But you can use framework function to do so.</li>\n<li>Zabbix agent autoinstallation and autoconfiguration suitable to use in puppet or another tool</li>\n<li>OS packaging support</li>\n<li>Zabbix API support</li>\n<li>Zabbix host autoregistration automation</li>\n<li>Zabbix sender and agent glue (send results of agent checks to zabbix sender)</li>\n<li>Zabbix backup support using zaf</li>\n<li>Support for wireless neighbours, clients with autodiscovery iwx module</li>\n<li>Support for automated import of hosts and items from CSV</li>\n<li>Support for fail2ban monitoring fail2ban</li>\n<li>Supoort for booked booked</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-installing-zaf\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/limos", "features": "Zabbix Agent|Zabbix Agent Active", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://github.com/limosek/zaf", "price": 0, "link_hits": 7092, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2016-04-04 14:25:30", "link_modified": "2017-01-30 13:56:51", "link_visited": 1396, "publish_up": "2016-04-04 14:25:30", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "", "author": "Lukas Macura", "user_id": 186, "link_id": 508, "cat_id": "231", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
