It was created</p>\n<p>under version 4.2.1, but it may run with earlier versions as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The python script discovers a lot of common services on your mail server</p>\n<p>and creates items and triggers for each and any service it found. Normally</p>\n<p>the discover process runs every 12 hours, while the checks are down every</p>\n<p>30 seconds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Installation</p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Copy the python script to /usr/local/bin. Make sure, you have at least</p>\n<p>Python 3.x installed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can edit this file for your needs. The simplest way is to add all</p>\n<p>your favorite services to the Enum called \"Services\". If you look at the</p>\n<p>code, you will see that this is not a big deal, even if you are not a</p>\n<p>developer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In Zabbix add the template as usual. After that, you can directly add the</p>\n<p>template to your host(s).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The template provides a macro</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MAILSERVER_IP = 127.0.0.1</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It scanns all services on the local IPv4 loopback interface. If you want</p>\n<p>to scan more than one IP address, simply override the macro and set all</p>\n<p>your hosts as a space seperated list. Also IPv6 is supported. Please no</p>\n<p>not add brackets to these addresses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is an example from my server:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MAILSERVER_IP = 127.0.0.1 134.255.226.248 2a05:bec0:28:1:134:255:226:248```</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Place the userparameter_mailserver.conf file in your zabbix-agent include</p>\n<p>folder. Mostly it has a name like</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here is some example of a graph:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As I am running the service under Gentoo, I can not provide a working</p>",
