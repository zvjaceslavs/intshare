Add a value mapping named `ciscoBgpPeerAdminStatus` with the following values:\n  * 1 => stop\n  * 2 => start\n2. Add a value mapping named `ciscoBgpPeerState` with the following values:\n  * 1 => idle\n  * 2 => connect\n  * 3 => active\n  * 4 => opensent\n  * 5 => openconfirm\n  * 6 => established\n3. Install [`as.name`](https://github.com/jjmartres/Zabbix/tree/master/zbx-scripts/as.name) in the **ExternalScripts** directory of your Zabbix server and/or proxy. Check your `zabbix_server.conf` and/or `zabbix_proxy.conf` if in doubt.\n4. Then `chmod a+x as.name`\n5. Import **zbx-cisco-bgp4.xml** file into Zabbix.\n6. Add to your host the **{$SNMP_COMMUNITY}** macro with your SNMP community as value.\n7. Add to your host the **{$BGP_PEER_AS}** macro with your list BGP peer remote AS as value (ex: ASN1|ASN2|ASN3)\n8. Associate **ZBX-CISCO-BGP4** template to the host.\n\n### Requirements\n\nThis template was tested for Zabbix 2.0.0 and higher.There are no additional requirements.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis template is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the  License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n### Copyright\n\n  Copyright (c) Jean-Jacques Martr\u00e8s\n\n### Authors\n\n  Jean-Jacques Martr\u00e8s\n  (jjmartres |at| gmail |dot| com)\n", "features": "SNMP", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://github.com/jjmartres/Zabbix", "price": 0, "link_hits": 11736, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2014-10-02 06:20:31", "link_modified": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "link_visited": 1659, "publish_up": "2014-10-01 21:41:47", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "zbx-cisco-bgp4.xml", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "cisco", "author": "Jean-Jacques Martr\u00e8s", "user_id": 118, "link_id": 237, "cat_id": "123", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
