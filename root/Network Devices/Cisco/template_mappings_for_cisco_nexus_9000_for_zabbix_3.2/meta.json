In Zabbix 3.2 you can import the value map first:</p>\n<p>Administration -> General -> Value mapping (top right dropdown) -> Import</p>\n<p>The template zip file also contains several regular expression definitions. I added these manually. There is an open ticket to support regular expression imports and exports, so there is no facility in Zabbix 3.2. They are just a few, and I added them manually at:</p>\n<p>Administration -> General -> Regular Expressions -> New regular expression</p>\n<p>Use expression type \"Result is TRUE\" for all of them (indicated by \"RESULTADO is VERDADERO\" in the files.) and copy&paste the expression into the web UI.</p>\n<p>Note that one of the references for the value maps in the template xml file uses: </p>\n<p>CISCO cefcPowerRedundancyMode</p>\n<p>you need to change that to:</p>\n<p>Cisco cefcPowerRedundancyMode </p>\n<p>before importing the template.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>", "features": "SNMP Agent", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "", "price": 0, "link_hits": 7495, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2017-05-17 07:52:26", "link_modified": "2017-05-17 07:53:08", "link_visited": null, "publish_up": "2017-05-17 07:52:26", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "cisco_mappings_zabbix_32.xml", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "", "author": "", "user_id": 2348, "link_id": 829, "cat_id": "123", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
