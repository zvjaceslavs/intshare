Install [`if.speed`](https://github.com/jjmartres/Zabbix/tree/master/zbx-scripts/if.speed) in the **ExternalScripts** directory of your Zabbix server and/or proxy. Check your `zabbix_server.conf` and/or `zabbix_proxy.conf` if in doubt.\n2. Then `chmod a+x if.speed`\n3. Add a value mapping named `ciscoCudldpInterfaceOperStatus` with the following values:\n  * 1 => shutdwon\n  * 2 => indeterminant\n  * 3 => biDirectional\n  * 4 => notApplicable\n4. Add a value mapping named `ciscoCudldpInterfaceOperMode` with the following values:\n  * 1 => enable\n  * 2 => disable\n  * 3 => aggressive\n4.
