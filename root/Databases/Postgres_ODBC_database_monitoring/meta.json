{"link_name": "Postgres ODBC database monitoring", "type": "Template", "OS": "", "vendor": "Others", "minZabbVer": "4.0.x", "link_desc": "<p>I have been looking for templates to use with the new ODBC database monitoring item type with out success. </p>\n<p>I have created a rudimentary one for postgres.   To use it follow these instructions for setting up ODBC on the server side.</p>\n<p>https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/config/items/itemtypes/odbc_checks</p>\n<p>We run multiple instances on each server so I create a host for each database and use the {HOST.NAME} macro in the item key.  If you want to use a different macro like {$DATABASE.NAME} then do a find and replace before you import this. As well all items have the name zabbix set as the user and the password set as \" my_password\". Again you may want to do a find and replace before importing.</p>\n<p>Then import this template and add it to the host you are using and then go through and double check the items.</p>\n<p>I know this functionality was in Zabbix 3 so this may work there but I created this in 4 so that is all I know it works with.  I hope some one finds this useful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>", "features": "Database Monitor", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "", "price": 0, "link_hits": 3163, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2018-12-18 01:29:02", "link_modified": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "link_visited": null, "publish_up": "2018-12-18 01:29:02", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "zbx_export_templates(2).xml", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "", "author": "J Villain", "user_id": 8774, "link_id": 1474, "cat_id": "111", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
