{"link_name": "zbxora Module and Template for Oracle", "type": "Module", "OS": "", "vendor": "Others", "minZabbVer": "2.2.x", "link_desc": "<p>zbxora, a powerful Oracle plugin plus template</p>\n<ul>\n<li>kiss</li>\n<li>small footprint</li>\n<li>easy to extend</li>\n<li>python powered</li>\n<li>responsive</li>\n<li>open for feature requests</li>\n<li>primary databases</li>\n<li>standby databases</li>\n<li>ASM instances</li>\n<li>RAC aware</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>extensible</h1>\n<p>For the admins having to monitor Oracle database it is very easy to add extra items to monitor. Even the lld feature it self is implemented as 'just a query'. You can easily define new items and have your own SQL added in your checks directories. The SQL returns the item_key and the value. No hocus pocus, no extra parameters, it is all SQL that does the job.</p>\n<p>Queries are organized in sections in an inifile style. Sections that have 'discover' in their name are treated as sections that containt LLD queries for which the output is transformed in a Json array that zabbix uses for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Other sections are just passing their query results as key, value pairs to zabbix. The keys are just part of the SQL output so you have full control. The order of SQL output columns must ben key, value.</p>\n<p>The result of zbxora.py is a file that is usable for zabbix_sender. If you only use a single database monitor, you could make zbxora launch zabbix_sender and upload it for you. If there are many databases monitored from the same client, it is more efficient to just collect the data and have a separate script collect the files, move them to a transit location and have that call zabbix_sender.</p>\n<p>Example for adding extra metrics: <a title=\"How to Create extra Metrics\" href=\"http://ronr.blogspot.nl/2015/10/how-to-create-new-metrics-for-zbxora.html\">http://ronr.blogspot.nl/2015/10/how-to-create-new-metrics-for-zbxora.html</a></p>\n<h1>zbxora-1.98 was the start for zbxdb</h1>\n<p>zbxdb now supports multiple database vendors and drivers.</p>\n<p>This makes zbxora deprecated. My advice is: go to zbxdb since it has the same specifications, just a minor modification for the connection parameter file is needed. Unlink the zbxora template and link the zbxdb template instead.</p>", "features": "Low Level Discovery (LLD)|Zabbix Trapper|Database Monitor|Custom Script", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://github.com/ikzelf/zbxora", "price": 0, "link_hits": 30365, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2015-09-15 08:45:08", "link_modified": "2018-07-24 12:06:05", "link_visited": 6792, "publish_up": "2015-09-15 08:45:08", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "", "author": "Ronald Rood", "user_id": 191, "link_id": 300, "cat_id": "148", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
