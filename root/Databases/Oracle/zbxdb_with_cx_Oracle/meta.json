{"link_name": "zbxdb with cx_Oracle", "type": "Module", "OS": "", "vendor": "Others", "minZabbVer": "2.2.x", "link_desc": "<p>Using the cx_Oracle driver, zbxdb fully supports Oracle. Built for 11g, running on 10g, 12c, 18 single and multi tenant databases. Runs on ASM as wel as on rdbms instances.  Supports all connection methods that sql*net offers. Monitors physical standby and primary databases out of the box. The queries use global views so in RAC all instances are monitored from 1 single session.</p>\n<p>Older versions will work but are not tested.</p>\n<p>Missing a metric? just add the sql for it in the etc/zbxdb_checks/oracle/*.cfg that fits your database version and role.</p>\n<p>Missing a version? Start with copying the best fitting version to the missing version name.</p>\n<p>See <a title=\"GitHub \" href=\"https://github.com/ikzelf/zbxdb\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ikzelf/zbxdb</a> for more info.</p>", "features": "Low Level Discovery (LLD)|Zabbix Trapper|Database Monitor|Custom Script", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://share.zabbix.com/databases/multi-databases/zbxdb-generic-database-plugin", "price": 0, "link_hits": 2472, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2019-04-23 13:57:19", "link_modified": "2019-12-12 15:23:40", "link_visited": 581, "publish_up": "2019-04-23 13:57:19", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "Oracle, primary, standby, RAC, ASM", "author": "Ronald Rood", "user_id": 191, "link_id": 1611, "cat_id": "148", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
