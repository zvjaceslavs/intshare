{"link_name": "Zabbix agent emulator for AS/400 platform", "type": "Module", "OS": "Other", "vendor": "", "minZabbVer": "2.0.x", "link_desc": "<h3>Summary:</h3>\n<p>v0.7.7. This is a small emulator of Zabbix agent for AS/400 platform. Main purpose: to access AS/400-specific objects (message queues, output queues, subsystems and jobs). It's written on Java using the IBM Toolbox for Java API and library, implemented as Jar-file ready to start (see details below).</p>\n<h3>Limitations:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>lack of IPv6 (IPv4 only supported);</li>\n<li>no encryption (sorry, no plans);</li>\n<li>only limited subset of standard metrics supported, and even in this case: some of them have a bit different semantics of parameters;</li>\n<li>some config file's parameters are recognized, but really ignored (PidFile, EnableRemoteCommand, Alias, AllowRoot, Include, UserParameter and LoadModule);</li>\n<li>configuration parameter ListenIP allows to set only one IP-address (contrary to list in original Zabbix-agent);</li>\n<li>minimum value for the StartAgents parameter is 1 (i.e. active-only mode is not supported);</li>\n<li>during message queue monitoring the integer part only of the message's EventID is transferred to Zabbix-server. It is restriction of Zabbix database schema (it has the integer type for the appropriate attribute). However, it's possible to use a regular expression in the item's key to filter by the full text value of EventID.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Requirements:</h3>\n<p>As this is a Java-program, you need a JRE to use it :-) This Jar-file has been compiled using JDK 1.8, but for running under JRE 1.7. So, you need minimum Java version 1.7. I tested it for monitoring our AS/400 system v 7.1; but it should, probably, work on other versions also.</p>\n<p>I tried to have minimum dependencies, but some still exist. You need 2 libraries: IBM Toolbox for Java (jt400.jar) and Simple JSON parser (json-simple-1.1.1.jar). The first library is included in the AS/400 operating system, or you can download an open-source version (JTOpen) from the sourceforge site (<a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/jt400/files/latest/download?source=files\">link</a>, you need only <strong>jt400.jar</strong> file from the archive). The second library is a tiny (<25KB) file for parsing JSON text, you can download it here (<a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/\">link</a>, you need the <strong>json-simple-1.1.1.jar</strong> file only).<br />Really, you need the following files and directories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>jt400.jar</strong>;</li>\n<li><strong>json-simple-1.1.1.jar</strong>;</li>\n<li><strong>ZabbixAgent.jar</strong> (in fact, Zabbix-agent emulator, this project);</li>\n<li>config file for the agent (default is \"zabbix_agentd.conf\" in current directory). Example is included, check and modify it for your environment;</li>\n<li>directory where the log file could be written (the only place where the write access is required).<br /><br /></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>File listing:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>ZabbixAgent.jar \u2013 Zabbix agent emulator;</li>\n<li>zabbix_agentd.conf \u2013 example of config file;</li>\n<li>readme", "features": "Low Level Discovery (LLD)|Zabbix Agent|Zabbix Agent Active", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "", "price": 0, "link_hits": 17889, "link_votes": 7, "link_rating": 5, "link_featured": 1, "link_created": "2016-11-21 15:00:24", "link_modified": "2019-10-08 13:11:13", "link_visited": null, "publish_up": "2016-11-21 15:00:24", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "as400.zip", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "as400, os400, i5os", "author": "Constantin Oshmyan", "user_id": 10759, "link_id": 683, "cat_id": "295", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
