Many thanks to him!</p>\n<p><a>https://share.zabbix.com/operating-systems/windows/windows-physical-drive-iops</a></p>\n<p>The original script worked, but wasn't able to distinguish a normal disk from an User Profile Disk when you try to monitor an RDS farm. I've made a few adjustments.</p>\n<p>Also, I don't like working with base64 encoded strings :)</p>\n<p>To make this work, do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Import the template</li>\n<li>Put the file \"discoverdisks.ps1\" in on the host under c:\\Zabbix. If you want to change this, also adjust the discovery rule</li>\n<li>Add the following lines to your zabbix agent config:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Timeout=10\nEnableRemoteCommands=1 \nUnsafeUserParameters=1\n</code></pre>\n<p>The discovery rule will use a powershell to collect all the disks. I've used the filter method in zabbix to get only the actual drives from C: to G:. If you have more, add them to the filter.</p>\n<p>I've tested this on Zabbix 4.4, but it should work as well for older versions.</p>", "features": "Zabbix Agent", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://github.com/jorisboth/Windows-Disk-Performance", "price": 0, "link_hits": 15990, "link_votes": 3, "link_rating": 5, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2019-10-24 14:00:27", "link_modified": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "link_visited": 3728, "publish_up": "2019-10-24 14:00:27", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "windows, iops, latency, disk", "author": "Joris Both", "user_id": 10905, "link_id": 1826, "cat_id": "180", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
