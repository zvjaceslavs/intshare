{"link_name": "Performance Co-Pilot to Zabbix interface modules", "type": "Module", "OS": "General", "vendor": "", "minZabbVer": "2.2.x", "link_desc": "<p>The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP, <a href=\"http://www.pcp.io/)\">http://www.pcp.io/)</a> system is a toolkit for collecting, archiving, and processing performance metrics from multiple operating systems.</p>\n<p>A typical Linux PCP installation offers over 1,000 metrics by default and is in turn extensible with its own plugins, or PMDAs (\"Performance Metrics Domain Agents\"). In addition to very complete /proc based statistics, readily available PCP PMDAs provide support for such system and application level components as 389 Directory Server, Apache, containers, HAProxy, GFS2, Gluster, KVM, MySQL, NFS, Oracle, Postfix, PostgreSQL, Samba, and Sendmail, among others. PCP also runs on many platforms, including Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and Windows.</p>\n<p>As of release 3.10.9, it includes a loadable module for Zabbix Agent to fetch arbitrary live PCP metrics.  For example, on  Fedora 22 x86-64, the <code>pcp-export-zabbix-agent</code> subrpm includes the module as <code>/usr/lib*/zabbix/agent/zbxpcp.so</code>.  Its man page is at <a href=\"http://www.pcp.io/man/man3/zbxpcp.3.html\">http://www.pcp.io/man/man3/zbxpcp.3.html</a> .<br /><br />As of release 3.12.2, it includes a program, <code>pcp2zabbix</code>, which can relay arbitrary sets of PCP metrics to a zabbix trapper using the plaintext sender protocol (<a href=\"http://zabbix.org/wiki/Docs/protocols/zabbix_sender/3.4\">http://zabbix.org/wiki/Docs/protocols/zabbix_sender/3.4</a> ). It can relay historical data from PCP archives, or live data from any reachable PCP server, with a variety of filtering / conversion / sampling options.
