The sensor discovery is simplistic and many assumptions were made, which might require little changes to make it work on other models.</p>\n<p>The discovery rules are set to 1 minute interval and the discovered items are also set to 1 minute interval in order to allow quick tests. <strong>For real deployments you should create your own template, link this template to your own template and override the discovery intervals with values that make sense for you</strong>. For example, we use 1 day interval for the discovery rules because our power topology is pretty static and once the first discovery is done there is no need to keep discovery rules running often.</p>\n<p>The triggers are defined based on the sensor states in order to respect the thresholds defined in each PDU, and for that reason the actual PDU thresholds don't show in the graphs.</p>\n<p>Suggestions and corrections are welcome, see <a href=\"https://github.com/BrandwatchLtd/zabbix-templates/tree/master/raritan-pdu-px3\">https://github.com/BrandwatchLtd/zabbix-templates/tree/master/raritan-pdu-px3</a></p>\n<p>Inspired in <a href=\"power-ups/legrand-inform/raritan-px-pdu\">https://share.zabbix.com/power-ups/legrand-inform/raritan-px-pdu</a></p>", "features": "SNMP Agent", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://github.com/BrandwatchLtd/zabbix-templates/tree/master/raritan-pdu-px3", "price": 0, "link_hits": 1051, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2020-03-30 18:46:36", "link_modified": "2020-03-30 18:51:44", "link_visited": 189, "publish_up": "2020-03-30 18:46:36", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "Template Raritan PDU PX3.xml", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "raritan, pdu, px3, snmp", "author": "Tiago TT", "user_id": 11556, "link_id": 2031, "cat_id": "342", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
