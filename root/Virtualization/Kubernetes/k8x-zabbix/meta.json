For example, the moment a deployment is created, it is also created in Zabbix using the <a href=\"https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/discovery/low_level_discovery\" rel=\"nofollow\">LLD</a> and its status changes are transferred to Zabbix without significant delay. This tool aggregates status information of entities in some cases to the managing entity to improve the practical usage with zabbix (example: aggegation of the pod statuses to the deployment which manages the pods) Disappearing entities will be deleted by zabbix using the \"Keep lost resources period\" setting.</p>\n<p>Optionally this tool can submit kubernetes entities to a webservice in unaggregated manner. This might be a very useful thing if you have left the GitOps paradigm behind and built a real management system for your infrastructure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>apiserver : Check and discover apiservers</li>\n<li>components : Check and discover health of k8s components (etcd, controller-manager, scheduler etc.)</li>\n<li>nodes: Check and discover active nodes</li>\n<li>pods: Check pods for restarts</li>\n<li>deployments: Check and discover deployments</li>\n<li>daemonsets: Check and discover daemonsets readiness</li>\n<li>replicasets: Check and discover replicasets readiness</li>\n<li>tls: Check tls secrets expiration dates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For details of the monitored kubernetes attributes, have a look at the <a href=\"http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zabbix-tooling/k8s-zabbix/blob/master/documentation/template/custom_service_kubernetes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">documentation</a></p>\n<p>The current docker image is published at <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/scoopex666/k8s-zabbix/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/scoopex666/k8s-zabbix/</a></p>\n<p>The project is managed at: <a href=\"https://github.com/zabbix-tooling/k8s-zabbix\">https://github.com/zabbix-tooling/k8s-zabbix</a></p>\n<p> </p>", "features": "Zabbix Agent", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://github.com/zabbix-tooling/k8s-zabbix", "price": 0, "link_hits": 2304, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2020-07-16 09:44:12", "link_modified": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "link_visited": 585, "publish_up": "2020-07-16 09:44:12", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "", "author": "", "user_id": 1509, "link_id": 2142, "cat_id": "424", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
