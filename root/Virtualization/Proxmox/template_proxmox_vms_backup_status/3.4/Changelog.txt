Found bug: in case of big installation, mounted storages can have similar names. Example:

cat /etc/pve/storage.cfg

nfs: fs
        ...
        path /mnt/pve/fs
	...

nfs: fsmain
        ...
        path /mnt/pve/fsmain
	...

nfs: fssecondary
        ...
        path /mnt/pve/fssecondary
	...

In this case script “proxmox-vms-backup-status” define all storages that fits by criterion, and get error, because path to backup files must be only one.
Solution. String 
backupdirectory=`cat $storageconfig|grep -A 1 $backupstorage|grep path|rev|cut -d " " -f 1|rev`
changed to:
backupdirectory=`cat $storageconfig|grep -w -A 1 $backupstorage|grep path|rev|cut -d " " -f 1|rev`
argument “-w” provides us exact search, without similar names. On my Proxmox machine now works correct.
