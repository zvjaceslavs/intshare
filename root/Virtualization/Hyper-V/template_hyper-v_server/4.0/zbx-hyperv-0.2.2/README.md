zbx-hyperv provides possibility to make Low Level Discovery of Hyper-V server VMs and retrieve their parameters, such "Memory Assigned", "CPU Usage", "State" etc. Attached template works only with Zabbix 4.0 and above.  
The script wrote with PowerShell and requires at least version 3.0 and Hyper-V module installed.

**Latest stable version:** 0.2.2

__Please, read [Requirements and Installation](https://github.com/asand3r/zbx-hyperv/wiki/Requirements-and-Installation) section in Wiki before use.__  

## Dependencies
 - PowerShell v3.0+

## Feautres  
**Low Level Discovery:**
 - [x] Virtual Machines
 - [x] Hyper-V Services

**Component status:**
 - [x] JSON for dependent items for VMs

## Supported arguments  
**-action**  
What we want to do - make LLD or get JSON with metric for dependent items (takes: lld, full)  
**-version**  
Print script version and exit.  

## Usage 
- LLD of virtual machines:
```powershell
PS C:\> .\zbx-hyperv.ps1 lld
{"data":[{"{#VM.NAME}":"vm01","{#VM.VERSION}":"5.0","{#VM.CLUSTERED}":1,"{#VM.HOST}":"hv01","{#VM.GEN}":2,"{#VM.ISREPLICA}":0}, ...}
```
- Request JSON with all VMs metrics:
```powershell
PS C:\> .\zbx-hyperv.ps1 full
{"vm01":{"IntSvcVer":"6.3.9600.18692","ReplMode":0,"Memory":4294967296,"ReplState":0,"NumaSockets":1,"Uptime":53505,"State":2,
"NumaNodes":1,"ReplHealth":0,"CPUUsage":0,"IntSvcState":0},...}
```

## Zabbix templates
In addition I've attached preconfigured Zabbix Template for version 4.0 and above (doesn't work with 3.0, 3.2, 3.4!), so you can use it in your environment. It's using Low Level Discovery functionality.

**Tested with**:  
Hyper-V on Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2 and 2016 and doesn't work with Hyper-V 2008 R2 and lower.
