Data is provided to Zabbix with a granularity of 5 minutes, this allows us to leverage the default statistics gathered by the PowerMax and not introduce any additional workload to the Unisphere server.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; color: #24292e; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji'; font-size: 16px;\">The integration consists of two components, a Template that is imported into Zabbix and a python script that is run from the Zabbix server. The script performs Discovery operations of array components via Zabbix LLD and also collects the performance statistics. We leverage the \u2018Zabbix Trapper\u2019 type for our items, using a python implementation of the Zabbix Sender protocol, which allows statistics collection to either be run as a scheduled \u2018external check\u2019 from within Zabbix or as a scheduled cron job on the system. The cron option is provided for especially large environments where the external check could run longer than the Zabbix timeout in some configurations. One instance of the script is run per PowerMax system.</p>", "features": "Zabbix Trapper", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://github.com/ktelep/Zabbix-DellEMC-PowerMax", "price": 0, "link_hits": null, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2021-02-04 16:17:07", "link_modified": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "link_visited": null, "publish_up": "2021-02-04 16:17:07", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "", "author": "Kurt Telep", "user_id": 363, "link_id": 2322, "cat_id": "173,112", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
