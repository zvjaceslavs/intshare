Could & should work on other systems aswell (eventually with small modifications) however it has only been tested on RPIs and DS18B20s.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p> This template will automatically find all 1wire devices and assume them to be temperature probes.</p>\n<p>It'll create items for every 1wire device it found under \"<span style=\"font-size: 12.16px;\">/sys/bus/w1/devices/</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.16px;\">\", convert the output to Celsius (in the correct fashion for DS18B20 probes) and create six threshold triggers aswell as a \"no data\"-trigger for each one.</span></p>\n<p>To better differentiate between the sensors you can assign a friendly name for probes using the following syntax: {$PROBE:\"1wire-ID\"}</p>\n<p>1wire-ID being the devices name, found under /sys/bus/w1/devices/. The set value will represent the friendly name.</p>\n<p>You also have the option to assign sensors to three different groups: 0, 1 and 2. This will modify the trigger behaviour for specific sensors.</p>\n<p>0 is using a normal temperature range calculated for server rooms, 1 is using an extended range and 2 is disabling triggers completly. The macro syntax for this is similar to the friendly name: {$GROUP:\"1wire-ID\"}</p>\n<p>The space limit unfortunatly doesn't allow me to tell you the thresholds here, however you can quickly see them in the trigger sections.</p>",
