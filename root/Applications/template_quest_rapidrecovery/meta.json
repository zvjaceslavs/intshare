Since then, the OIDS used to define Repositories and Protected Agents has changed. A newer template, known working on Rapid Recovery **6.4.0.718**, has been created and uploaded. The older template with old OIDs still is present (**..._legacy.xml**). At this time, I don't know exactly when the OIDs changed.\n\nIf you want to know which to use, query your RapidRecovery instance. If you get results at OID **.1.3.6.1.4.1.7572.200.100.200**, use the new version of the template. If you get results at OID **1.3.6.1.4.1.674.11000.1000.200.100.300.1.3**, use the legacy version.\n\n## Goals\n  - General Repository Health Info\n  - Protected Agents\n    - How many Recovery Points\n    - Last protection time\n    - State & Status of Replication\n   \n### Method\nBy utilizing the standard Quest .MIB file that is included with RR instances, we will use SNMPv1 to query date from the server. Use the standard `{$SNMP_COMMUNITY}` for authentication to the device.\n\nNOTE: By default, SNMP handling on RapidRecovery Cores is disabled. This must be enabled, and ports *<sub>(Default UDP/8161)</sub>* opened on the firewall.\n\n## Known Issues\n  - The Web Scenario that is included with the template does not authenticate properly. A simple requirement for the scenario at this point is simply to expect a 401 Unauth. Not ideal, therefore no triggers are configured for the canned Web Scenario.</span></span>\n</pre>\n<p> </p>",
