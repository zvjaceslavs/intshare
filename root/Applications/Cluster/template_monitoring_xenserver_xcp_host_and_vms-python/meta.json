However, when you have an environment with many pools to manage, you woulding need to create another script to add to another pool.<br /><br />In this modification, the script writes the file specifying which server was managed 'at that time', obeying the pattern \"/tmp/xenapi.hostperformance.tmp.NAME-OF-HOSTSERVER\".<br />With this you can capture all the information regarding the server without having to create other calls using duplicate script.<br /><br />Another change was the way he handles passwords.<br />In the original script you would have to put the password in 'plain text' as a parameter in the script execution, this means that there in the zabbix php web form (template configuration) you would have to type the password in 'plain text', the which is a tremendous insecurity.<br /><br />In this script we try to solve this problem by creating a function to read the credentials (scrambled with base64) of a file (credentials.txt) that will be in the same directory as the citrix.xenserver.py script. So you can leave the username and password parameter blank in zabbix web which will not influence script execution since these credentials will be read from this file in the directory inside the zabbix operating system.<br /><br />more: https://gitlab.com/mlustosa/xenserver-zabbix-monitoring<br /><br />Marllus Lustosa - marlluslustosa@gmail.com<br />Fabr\u00edcio Silva  - fabricio.silva@sti.ufc.br<br />Change: 25.
