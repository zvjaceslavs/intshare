The simplest Keepalived implementation is only implementing VRRP failover and requires only the templates:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1) Template SNMP Keepalived Global</p>\n<p>2) Template SNMP Keepalived VRRP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Keepalived implemetation that provides LVS load balancing defined by IP address or fwmark requires, additionally:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3) Template SNMP Keepalived Check Virtual Servers</p>\n<p>4) Template SNMP Keepalived Check Real Servers</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Keepalived implemetation that provides LVS load balancing defined by on or more Virtual Server Groups requires, additionally:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5) Template SNMP Keepalived Check Virtual Server Groups</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The included KEEPALIVED-MIB file must be installed in the Zabbix Server's SNMP MIBs path to provide the textual snmpbulkget support configured in the templates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1. Prerequisites</p>\n<p>Net-SNMP installed and running on the Keepalived servers.</p>\n<p>Keepalived compiled with SNMP support and enabled in the startup script (i.e. using the --snmp daemon argument).</p>\n<p>The KEEPALIVED-MIB file in the Zabbix Server's SNMP mibs path.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2.  Templates</p>\n<p>There are five templates that correspond to the structure of the KEEPALIVED-MIB:</p>\n<p>1) Template SNMP Keepalived Global</p>\n<p>2) Template SNMP Keepalived VRRP</p>\n<p>3) Template SNMP Keepalived Check Virtual Servers</p>\n<p>4) Template SNMP Keepalived Check Real Servers</p>\n<p>5) Template SNMP Keepalived Check Virtual Server Groups</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2.1 Template SNMP Keepalived Global</p>\n<p>This template contains only configuration information. Checks are disabled by default.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2.2 Template SNMP Keepalived VRRP</p>\n<p>This template contains both configuration and monitoring information.  Only the monitoring information is enabled.  The template utilizes SNMP Low Level Discovery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2.3 Template SNMP Keepalived Check Virtual Servers</p>\n<p>This template contains both configuration and monitoring information.  Only the monitoring information is enabled.  The template utilizes SNMP Low Level Discovery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2.4 Template SNMP Keepalived Check Real Servers</p>\n<p>This template contains both configuration and monitoring information.  Checks are disabled by default.  Due to the MIB structure's dynamic OID assignment, it is not amenable to SNMP Low Level Discovery and requires manual configuration (see below).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2.5 Template SNMP Keepalived Check Virtual Server Groups</p>\n<p>This template contains only configuration information.  Only the monitoring information is enabled.  A single SNMP Low Level Discovery item is included to enumerate only the Virtual Server Group Names.  Due to the MIB structure's dynamic OID assignment, it is not amenab",
