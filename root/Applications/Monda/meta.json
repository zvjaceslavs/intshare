At this moment, only Zabbix is supported. Please, read documentation before using this package. Monda can be performance killer for your Zabbix installation! Monda works with mysql and postgres as backend server for Zabbix. Monda can discover nice correlations in your setup and many more things. See example results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Two databases concept</h1>\n<p><br />Monda is developed with dual database concept. One is native Zabbix database, used by Zabbix server, second is Monda database. In theory, both of them can be one database system, but main concept of Monda is, to analyze data in idle server time and not to slowdown any Zabbix process. From this reason, Monda uses its own database system for storing its data.<br />More zabbixes in one Monda database<br /><br />It is possible to analyse more zabbix servers using one monda database. You can use zabbix_alias or zabbix_id for this. All statistics, correlation and other facts about zabbix servers will be in one monda database.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See project page at <a href=\"https://github.com/limosek/monda\" target=\"_blank\">github</a></p>", "features": "Other", "address": "", "city": "", "state": "", "country": "", "postcode": "", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "email": "", "website": "https://github.com/limosek/monda", "price": 0, "link_hits": 3133, "link_votes": null, "link_rating": 0, "link_featured": null, "link_created": "2016-08-03 18:28:13", "link_modified": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "link_visited": 641, "publish_up": "2016-08-03 18:28:13", "publish_down": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "metakey": "", "metadesc": "", "1.8": "", "2.0": "", "2.2": "", "2.4": "", "3.0": "", "3.2": "", "3.4": "", "4.0": "", "4.2": "", "4.4": "", "5.0": "", "5.2": "", "tags": "", "author": "Lukas Macura", "user_id": 186, "link_id": 596, "cat_id": "115", "internal_notes": "", "lat": 0, "lng": 0, "zoom": ""}
