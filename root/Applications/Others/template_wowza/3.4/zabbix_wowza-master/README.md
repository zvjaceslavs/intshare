#zabbix_wowza

Zabbix template for Wowza Media Server.
HTTP requests to Wowza Media Server are cached locally to avoid querying server for each key retrieved.
Request is made once for all the counters and cached by default for 295 seconds.
To reduce update interval for each item reduce the caching time of the wowza_stats.py script by passing --ttl value or change it in the script.
