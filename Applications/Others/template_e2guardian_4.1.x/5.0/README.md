## Items collected

|Name|Description|Type|Key and additional info|
|----|-----------|----|----|
|e2guardian - log queue|<p>5. logQ - Number of messages waiting to be logged to disk. In normal use 0. An increase in number may indicate system overloading, but should not otherwise affect performance.</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},5]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - connections per second|<p>7. conx/s - average connections per sec over period since last stats line.</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},7]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - httpworkers queue|<p>4. httpwQ - Number of connections waiting in queue for a worker thread. In normal use this will be 0 (and on occasion 1 or 2) but will increase once all worker threads are busy. Lowish numbers are OK for transitory peaks. High numbers indicate an overloaded system. If there is still memory and cpu available, then httpworkers may be increased.</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},4]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - httpworkers busy|<p>3. busy - Number of httpworker threads busy handling connections at current time</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},3]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - requests since last stats dump|<p>8. reqs - indication of number of requests handled since last stats line. Only an indication as requests made over https tunnels (i.e. non-MITM) cannot be counted, so each https tunnel is counted as one request.</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},8]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - maximum number file descriptor in use|<p>10. maxfd - Indication of maximum number file descriptor in use</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},10]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - Number of List Option Containers in use|<p>11. LCcnt - Number of List Option Containers in use. A new List Option Container is created at start up and on gentle restart. Old containers are deleted once all connections still using it have finished. Normally figure will be one, but may rise after a gentle restart(s) and should return to one after a period of time.</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},11]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - total sum connections each 5 minutes|<p>6. conx - number of connections handled since last stats line.</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},6]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - timestamp of dstats dump|<p>1. Time - in unix format</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},1]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - requests per second|<p>9. reqs/s - average requests per sec over period since last stats line.</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},9]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
|e2guardian - httpworkers total|<p>2. httpw - Number of httpworker threads running</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|e2guardian[{$E2GUARDIAN_DSTATS},2]<p>Update: 5m</p>|
