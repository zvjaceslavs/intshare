## Items collected

|Name|Description|Type|Key and additional info|
|----|-----------|----|----|
|Media Relay: Media Connectivity Check Failure|<p>This component monitor returns the number of calls where media connectivity between the Mediation Server and the remote endpoints could not be established. The returned value should be as low as possible.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\LS:MediationServer - Media Relay\- Media Connectivity Check Failure"]<p>Update: 60</p>|
|Outbound Calls: Active media bypass calls|<p>This component monitor returns the total number of active calls going through Mediation Server that are in Media Bypass mode. Calls using Media Bypass use significantly fewer Mediation Server resources because the media is not flowing through the Mediation Server.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\LS:MediationServer - Outbound Calls(_total)\- Active media bypass calls"]<p>Update: 60</p>|
|Inbound Calls: Current|<p>This component monitor returns the number of inbound calls in progress.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\LS:MediationServer - Inbound Calls(_total)\- current"]<p>Update: 60</p>|
|Service: Lync Server Replica Replicator Agent|<p>-</p>|`Zabbix agent`|service.info["Lync Server Replica Replicator Agent", state]<p>Update: 300</p>|

|CDR adapter problem|<p>-</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|eventlog["Lync Server",,,,56207]<p>Update: 180</p>|
|Health Indices: Load Call Failure Index|<p>This component monitor returns the scaled index between zero and 100 that is related to all call failures due to Global Health Index as a heavy load.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\LS:MediationServer - Health Indices\- Load Call Failure Index"]<p>Update: 60</p>|
|Global Counters: Current audio channels with PSM quality reporting|<p>This component monitor returns the total number of active channels that are having Phase Shift Modulation (PSM) quality reported. Calculating PSM quality has a processing overhead so this should be taken into account when measuring performance.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\LS:MediationServer - Global Counters\- Current audio channels with PSM quality reporting"]<p>Update: 60</p>|
|Service: Lync Server Mediation|<p>-</p>|`Zabbix agent`|service.info["Lync Server Mediation", state]<p>Update: 300</p>|

|Total failed calls caused by unexpected interaction from the Proxy|<p>This component monitor returns the number of calls that failed because of an unexpected response from the Front End Server. The returned value should be as low as possible.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\LS:MediationServer - Global Counters\- Total failed calls caused by unexpected interaction from the Proxy"]<p>Update: 60</p>|
|Total failed calls caused by unexpected interaction from a gateway|<p>This component monitor returns the number of calls that failed because of an unexpected response from a gateway peer. The returned value should be as low as possible.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\LS:MediationServer - Global Per Gateway Counters(_Total)\- Total failed calls caused by unexpected interaction from a gateway"]<p>Update: 60</p>|
