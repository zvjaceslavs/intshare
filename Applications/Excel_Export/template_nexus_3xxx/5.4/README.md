# NEXUS 3xxx

## Description

A template to monitor nexus switch via SNMP

## Overview

A Nexus 3xxx template to get SNMP system informations.


This template will find interface, CPU, Fan, create graphs, check ip/tcp/udp/icmp information, create some triggers etc...


All items, triggers and discovery rules have brief descriptions.


If SNMP is not your friend, you can check this web page (https://cric.grenoble.cnrs.fr/Administrateurs/Outils/MIBS/?oid=1.3.6.1.2.1) to help you.
