# HAProxy

## Overview

 How to install:


1. Add in HAProxy (or make sure that you have) next rules to enable statistics on socket


vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg  
stats socket /var/lib/haproxy/stats mode 666 level admin  
stats timeout 30s  



2. Install socat and nc: yum install nc socat -yum


3. Make sure that HAProxy user can read from socket :sudo -uhaproxy echo "show info;show stat" | socat stdio unix-connect:/var/lib/haproxy/stats


4. Copy files:


a) `userparameter\_haproxy.conf` in `/etc/zabbix/zabbix\_agentd.d/`


b) haproxy\_discovery.sh in /etc/zabbix/scripts/


c) haproxy\_stats.sh in /etc/zabbix/scripts/  
  
Make b and c scripts executable with chmod +x script\_name  
  
Note: Make sure that /etc/zabbix/scripts/ exist, if not, create it: mkdir -p /etc/zabbix/scripts/  
  
5. Add host for HAProxy in Zabbix, add template, wait some time for get data  
  
(You can change LLD discovery time to get data more faster, but after change to initial)  
  
This template is based on:  
  
a) Solution by Anastas Dancha  - https://github.com/anapsix/zabbix-haproxy  
  
b) Official template from Zabbix for Zabbix > 4.4 - https://www.zabbix.com/integrations/haproxy  
  
The reason why I create this template was to have official zabbix template logic in Zabbix under 4.4  
  
Files are there  
  
a) https://cloud.mail.ru/public/D2M5%2F7ZEamjnVF  
  
b) https://drive.google.com/open?id=16xoJyWut9R\_EudcRyAf2Ui8WuPyTxw6D

|HAProxy Backend [{#BACKEND_NAME}]: Responses denied per second|<p>Responses denied due to security concerns (ACL-restricted). In most cases denials will originate in the frontend (e.g., a user is attempting to access an unauthorized URL). However, sometimes a request may be benign, yet the corresponding response contains sensitive information. In that case, you would want to set up an ACL to deny the offending response. Backend responses that are denied due to ACL restrictions will emit a 502 error code. With properly configured access controls on frontend, this metric should stay at or near zero. Denied responses and an increase in 5xx responses go hand-in-hand. If you are seeing a large number of 5xx responses, you should check your denied responses to shed some light on the increase in error codes</p>|`Zabbix agent (active)`|haproxy.stats[{$HAPROXY_SOCK},{#BACKEND_NAME},BACKEND,dresp]<p>Update: 60</p><p>LLD</p>|

However, a significant increase in the number of invalid requests received could be a sign of larger, looming issues. For example, an abnormal number of terminations or timeouts by numerous clients could mean that your application is experiencing excessive latency, causing clients to manually close their connections.</p>|<p>**Expression**: {HAProxy:haproxy.stats[/var/lib/haproxy/stats,{#FRONTEND_NAME},FRONTEND,ereq].min(5m)}>10</p><p>**Recovery expression**: </p>|average|

Unlike requests, upon reaching the session limit HAProxy will deny additional clients until resource consumption drops. Furthermore, if you find your session usage percentage to be hovering above 80%, it could be time to either modify HAProxy’s configuration to allow more sessions, or migrate your HAProxy server to a bigger box.</p>|<p>**Expression**: {HAProxy:haproxy.stats[/var/lib/haproxy/stats,{#FRONTEND_NAME},FRONTEND,sutil].min(5m)}>80</p><p>**Recovery expression**: </p>|average|
