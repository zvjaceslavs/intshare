|Exchange RpcClientAccess\RPC Averaged Latency|<p>Shows the average latency, in ms, of the most recent RPCs to the Information Store service. These RPCs are used to get content for the filter daemon for the specified database. Should coincide with the latencies that Outlook clients are experiencing. MODIFIED_FOR_EX2016-WAS:perf_counter[" MSExchange Search Indices(*) Average Latency of RPCs Used to Obtain Content"]</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange RpcClientAccess\RPC Averaged Latency"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Store Interface(*) RPC Slow Requests latency average (msec)|<p>Shows the average latency, in ms, of slow requests. Used for determining the average latencies of RPC slow requests.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Store Interface(*)\RPC Slow Requests latency average (msec)"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Database I/O Database Reads (Recovery) Average Latency|<p>Indicates the average time, in ms, to read from the database file. The average value should be below 200 ms. Spikes (maximum values) shouldn't be higher than 1,000 ms.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database(*)\I/O Database Reads (Recovery) Average Latency"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange ADAccess Domain Controllers(*)\LDAP Search Time|<p>-</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange ADAccess Domain Controllers(*)\LDAP Search Time"]<p>Update: 30s</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Database (Information Store) Database Page Fault Stalls/sec|<p>Shows the rate that database file page requests require of the database cache manager to allocate a new page from the database cache. If this value is nonzero, this indicates that the database isn't able to flush dirty pages to the database file fast enough to make pages free for new page allocations.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database(Information Store)\Database Page Fault Stalls/sec"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox IS RPC Operations/sec|<p>Indicates the current number of RPC operations occurring per second. Should closely correspond to historical baselines. Values much higher than expected indicate that the workload has changed, while values much lower than expected indicate a bottleneck preventing client requests from reaching the server. MODIFIED_FOR_EX2016-WAS:perf_counter[" MSExchangeIS RPC Operations/sec"]</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchangeIS Store(*)\RPC Operations/sec"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Transport Q - Msgs Queued for Delivery/sec|<p>Shows the number of messages queued for delivery per second. Determines current load. Compare values to historical baselines.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchangeTransport Queues(_total)\Messages Queued for Delivery Per Second"]<p>Update: 30s</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Database (Information Store) Database Cache % Hit|<p>Shows the percentage of database file page requests fulfilled by the database cache without causing a file operation. If this percentage is too low, the database cache size may be too small. Should be over 90% for companies with majority online mode clients. Should be over 99% for companies with majority cached mode clients. If the hit ratio is less than these numbers, the database cache may be insufficient.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database(Information Store)\Database Cache % Hit"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Resource Booking  Average Resource Booking Processing Time|<p>Shows the average time to process an event in the Resource Booking Attendant. Should be a low value at all times. High values may indicate a performance bottleneck.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Resource Booking\Average Resource Booking Processing Time"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Database (Information Store) Database Cache Size (GB)|<p>Shows the amount of system memory, in megabytes (MB), used by the database cache manager to hold commonly used information from the database files to prevent file operations. Maximum value is RAM-2GB (RAM-3GB for servers with sync replication enabled). This and Database Cache Hit % are useful counters for gauging whether a server's performance problems might be resolved by adding more physical memory. Use this counter along with store private bytes to determine if there are store memory leaks. If the database cache size seems too small for optimal performance and there is little available memory on the system (check the value of Memory/Available Bytes), adding more memory to the system may increase performance. If there is ample memory on the system and the database cache size isn't growing beyond a certain point, the database cache size may be capped at an artificially low limit. Increasing this limit may increase performance.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database(Information Store)\Database Cache Size (MB)"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Database ==> Instances(*) Log Generation Checkpoint Depth|<p>Represents the amount of work in the log file count that needs to be redone or undone to the database files if the process fails. Should be below 500 at all times for the Mailbox server role. A healthy server should indicate between 20 and 30 for each database instance. If checkpoint depth increases continually for a sustained period, this indicates either a long-running transaction, (which will impact the version store), or a bottleneck involving the database disks.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database ==> Instances(*)\Log Generation Checkpoint Depth"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Transport Database ==> Instances(edgetransport/Transport Mail Database) Log Generation Checkpoint Depth|<p>Represents the amount of work (in count of log files) that needs to be redone or undone to the database files if the process fails.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database ==> Instances(edgetransport/Transport Mail Database)\Log Generation Checkpoint Depth"]<p>Update: 30s</p>|

|Exchange Mailbox Database I/O Log Reads Average Latency|<p>Indicates the average time, in ms, to read data from a log file. Specific to log replay and database recovery operations.

|Exchange Mailbox IS Client(*) RPC Operations/sec|<p>Shows what client protocol is performing an excessive amount of RPC Operations/sec. High IMAP4, POP3, or Outlook Anywhere latency can indicate problems with Client Access servers rather than Mailbox servers. This is especially true when other clients (which includes MAPI) latency is lower in comparison. In some instances, high IMAP latencies could indicate a bottleneck on the Mailbox server in addition to the latencies that the Client Access server is experiencing.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchangeIS Client Type(*)\RPC Operations/sec"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Database (Information Store) Version buckets allocated|<p>Shows the total number of version buckets allocated. Should be less than 12,000 at all times. The maximum default version is 16,384. If version buckets reach 70% of maximum, the server is at risk of running out of the version store.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database(Information Store)\Version buckets allocated"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Mailbox Database I/O Log Writes Average Latency|<p>Indicates the average time, in ms, to write a log buffer to the active log file. This counter should be 10 on production servers. If this counter is greater than 10, it's an indication that the MSExchange Database I/O Database Writes (Attached) Average Latency is too high.</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database(*)\I/O Log Writes Average Latency"]<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Exchange Transport Database ==> Instances(edgetransport/Transport Mail Database) I/O Log Writes/sec|<p>-</p>|`Zabbix agent`|perf_counter["\MSExchange Database ==> Instances(edgetransport/Transport Mail Database)\I/O Log Writes/sec"]<p>Update: 30s</p>|
