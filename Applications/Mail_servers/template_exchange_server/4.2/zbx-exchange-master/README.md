## Script Usage 
- Database discovery for Exchange Server 2016:

{"data":[{"{#DB.NAME}":"DB1","{#DB.LCNAME}":"db1","{#DB.EDBPATH}":"D:\\Databases\\DB 1.edb"}, ... ]}
PS C:\> .\zbx-exchange.ps1 -ExchVersion 2016
{"data":[{"{#DB.NAME}":"DB1","{#DB.LCNAME}":"db1","{#DB.EDBPATH}":"D:\\Databases\\DB 1.edb"}, ... ]}
```
- Database discovery for Exchange Server 2010:
```powershell
PS C:\> .\zbx-exchange.ps1 -ExchVersion 2010
{"data":[{"{#DB.NAME}":"DB1","{#DB.LCNAME}":"db1","{#DB.EDBPATH}":"D:\\Databases\\DB 1.edb"}, ... ]}
```

## Installation
I'm using next foldes structure for my userparameters and scripts:
- "C:\Program Files\Zabbix Agent\scripts" for scripts
- "C:\Program Files\Zabbix Agent\userparameters" for additional config files included to main Zabbix Agent config with "Include" option.  
So, based on it, installation will be contents next steps:  
- Copy _zbx-exchange.conf_ to the _userparameters_ dir;
- Copy _zbx-exchange.ps1_ to the _scripts_ dir;
- Increase Timeout in Zabbix Agent config file at least to 10 seconds;
- Restart Zabbix Agent Service;

## Zabbix template
In addition I've attached preconfigured Zabbix Template for version 4.2, so you can use it in your environment.  
The template contains two LLD rules:
  - Exchange Database Discovery
  - Exchange Services Discovery
The first one uses _zbx-exchange.ps1_ script and the second one - built-in 'service.discovery', so, if you already has LLD for services, you must remove one of them.  
All perfomance counters thresholds has been taken from this page:
