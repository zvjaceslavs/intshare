# Halley UPS Legrand cs121

## Overview

Template for monitoring UPS Legrand CS 121 (all models) with explanations and advices. The mibs are there: <http://ups.legrand.com/software/>


The content of template:


**5 Applications**: General, Health, Input, Output, Battery


**18 Items:**


Input voltage, Battery Status ,Estimated minutes remaining if no power , Bypass Voltage


Alarms present on {HOST.NAME}, Bypass Current, Bypass Power


Input line bads, Output Power, Output load in percent


Seconds on battery, Output Voltage


Estimated charge remaining, Battery voltage


Battery temperature, Device Version


Device Name, Device Model


13 Triggers and 4 Graphs


The template use SNMP agent v2. Assure that you set the community in template macros.


Assure also that in Administration -> General -> Value mapping you have under APC Battery Status next values


1 ⇒ unknown  
2 ⇒ batteryNormal  
3 ⇒ batteryLow  
4 ⇒ batteryDepleted

## Items collected

|Name|Description|Type|Key and additional info|
|----|-----------|----|----|
|Bypass Voltage|<p>An automatic bypass of voltage is used by the UPS to switch its load to the mains if it experiences an overload or internal failure. In other words, this mean that UPS has some problems and switch to the main (wall) power. So, if we have bypass - in bypass time our servers are connected directly to the line power - and are exposed to all electricity hazards</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsBypassVoltage.1<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Output Voltage|<p>The present output voltage.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsOutputVoltage.1<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Bypass Power|<p>An automatic bypass is used by the UPS to switch its load to the mains if it experiences an overload or internal failure. In other words, this mean that UPS has some problems and switch to the main (wall) power. So, if we have bypass - in bypass time our servers are connected directly to the line power - and are exposed to all electricity hazards This item show the power that we have in bypass time</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsBypassPower.1<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Input line bads|<p>A count of the number of times the input entered an out-of-tolerance condition as defined by the manufacturer. This count is incremented by one each time the input transitions from zero out-of-tolerance lines to one or more input lines out-of-tolerance. A big number show problems with the electricity power where your UPS is connected</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsInputLineBads<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Seconds on battery|<p>If the unit is on battery power, the elapsed time since the UPS last switched to battery power, or the time since the network management subsystem was last restarted, whichever is less. Zero shall be returned if the unit is not on battery power.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsSecondsOnBattery<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Estimated charge remaining|<p>An estimate of the battery charge remaining expressed as a percent of full charge.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsEstimatedChargeRemaining<p>Update: 60</p>|
|Device Name|<p>The name of the UPS manufacturer.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsIdentManufacturer<p>Update: 600</p>|
|Estimated minutes remaining if no power|<p>An estimate of the time to battery charge depletion under the present load conditions if the utility power is off and remains off, or if it were to be lost and remain off.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Device Model|<p>The UPS Model designation.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsIdentModel<p>Update: 86400</p>|
|Battery Status|<p>The indication of the capacity remaining in the UPS system's batteries. A value of batteryNormal indicates that the remaining run-time is greater than upsConfigLowBattTime. A value of batteryLow indicates that the remaining battery run-time is less than or equal to upsConfigLowBattTime. A value of batteryDepleted indicates that the UPS will be unable to sustain the present load when and if the utility power is lost (including the possibility that the utility power is currently absent and the UPS is unable to sustain the output).</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsBatteryStatus<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Alarms present on {HOST.NAME}|<p>The present number of active alarm conditions.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsAlarmsPresent<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Device Version|<p>The UPS agent software version.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsIdentAgentSoftwareVersion<p>Update: 600</p>|
|Output load in percent|<p>The percentage of the UPS power capacity presently being used on this output line, i.e., the greater of the percent load of true power capacity and the percent load of VA.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsOutputPercentLoad.1<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Input voltage|<p>The magnitude of the present input voltage.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsInputVoltage.1<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Battery temperature|<p>The ambient temperature at or near the UPS Battery casing.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsBatteryTemperature<p>Update: 60</p>|
|Bypass Current|<p>An automatic bypass of voltage is used by the UPS to switch its load to the mains if it experiences an overload or internal failure. In other words, this mean that UPS has some problems and switch to the main (wall) power. So, if we have bypass - in bypass time our servers are connected directly to the line power - and are exposed to all electricity hazards. This item show the amperage that we have in bypass time</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsBypassCurrent.1<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Output Power|<p>The present output true power.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsOutputPower.1<p>Update: 30</p>|
|Battery voltage|<p>The magnitude of the present battery voltage.</p>|`SNMP agent`|upsBatteryVoltage<p>Update: 60</p>|
