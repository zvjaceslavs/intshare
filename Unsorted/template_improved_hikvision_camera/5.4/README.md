# Security Cameras - HikVision

## Description

Based of SNMP v2 Generic

## Overview

Utilizes ICMP, SNMP and a Web Check against the RTSP connection to verify the camera is working.


HikVision provide minimal data over SNMP so there is not much pulled from there however I have pulled the following information into inventory


 


System Firmware Version > OS  
System MAC Address > MAC Address A  
System Model > Model  
System Manufacturer > Vendor


 


You will need to ensure that your SNMP Macro is set correctly for the cameras (or override it at the Template or Host level) and set the RTSP\_USER and RTSP\_PASS macro's in the template to allow the RTSP check to work
