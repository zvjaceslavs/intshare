        ## Overview
        
        Template for monitoring Linux Disk with iostat with explanations and advices.
        
        
        Use LLD discovery: discover only [hsv]d[a-z]
        
        
        The idea is from <https://wiki.enchtex.info/howto/zabbix/zabbix_iostat_monitoring>
        
        
        I edited the script and add explanations and advises to the template
        
        
        Script write data in a cache file to not make a lot of requests
        
        
        To install: follow instructions from <https://cloud.mail.ru/public/6LpD/qkVgL4E8z>
        
        
        Any recommends are welcome
