## Overview

RDP Logged on Users


I use this template to check Users, that are logged on RDP sessions on Windows servers. It's not full audit, it's only for current view of logged-on users.


Template is really simple.It has only one Item and user parameter configured on monitored server.


User parameter in zabbix\_agentd.conf: UserParameter=RDPUsers,"c:\zabbix\RDPUsers.cmd" Script RDPUsers.cmd:


@echo off


for /F "usebackq tokens=1,2,3,4,5*" %%i in (`qwinsta ^| find "Active"`) do (


 if "%%l" == "Active" ( echo %%j )


)


I was asked to enhance script for monitoring disconnected terminal users too. So this is my second version of script. Script adds "D:" before name for disconnecter users and "A: "for Active users. Script was tested only for English version of Windows server:


New script RDPUsers.cmd:


@echo off


for /F "usebackq tokens=1,2,3,4,5*" %%i in (`query user 2^>nul`) do (


 if "%%l" == "Active" ( echo A: %%i )


 if "%%k" == "Disc" ( echo D: %%i )


)
